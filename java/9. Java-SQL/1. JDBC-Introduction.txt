 JDBC - (Java Database Connectivity)
=====================================
    - JDBC is a Java API (a set of classes and interfaces) 
    - that allows Java programs to communicate with databases.
    - It acts like a bridge between your Java application and a database (like MySQL, Oracle, etc.).
    - You use JDBC to send SQL queries (like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) from Java and get results back.
