Java Exception Handling:-
===========================

    Java Exception Handling is a powerful mechanism used to handle runtime errors, 
    allowing a program to continue its execution or fail gracefully. 

Types of Exceptions:
====================

    Checked Exceptions – Checked at compile-time (e.g., IOException, SQLException)

    Unchecked Exceptions – Checked at runtime (e.g., ArithmeticException, NullPointerException)

    Errors – Serious problems not intended to be caught by applications (e.g., OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError)
