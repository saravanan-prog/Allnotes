   2. Thread Lifecycle
   ===================

        New                 –   Thread is created but not started
        Runnable            –   After calling start()
        Running             –   When CPU picks it for execution
        Blocked/Waiting     –   Waiting for resources or signal
        Terminated          –   When run() completes or an exception occurs
