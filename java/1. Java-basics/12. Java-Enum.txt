Java enum    
==========
      
    -  A collection of constant values is called enum
    -  this is implicitly having public static final        


        enum Color {
            RED, GREEN, BLUE
        }



Example:
--------
    enum Weekday {
        MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Weekday today = Weekday.MONDAY;
            System.out.println("Today is " + today);
        }
    }


    Output

    Today is MONDAY
