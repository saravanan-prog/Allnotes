Java Type Casting
=================
    Type casting in Java is converting one data type to another.

        1. Widening Casting (automatic)

           - From smaller to larger type:

                    int to long, 
                    float to double.
            
            Example
            -------

                int i = 10;
                long l = i;      // automatic


        2. Narrowing Casting (manual)

            - From larger to smaller type:
                 double to int. Requires cast.

                  double d = 9.99;
                  int i = (int) d;           // manual cast, i = 9
