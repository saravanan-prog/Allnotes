Inheritance in Java
====================
    Inheritance: 

        A class inherits properties and methods from another class.
        Use extends keyword.

        Example :-

            class Animal {
                void eat() {}
            }
            class Dog extends Animal {
                void bark() {}
            }
    

    Types of Inheritance 
    --------------------
        - Single inheritance: A super class inherit to one derived class.

        - Multilevel inheritance: A class inherit a class that derived to another class. in simple term [chain relationship]

        - Hierarchical inheritance: one super class extended by multiple derived classes.

        - Hybrid inheritance - Hybrid Inheritance is a type of inheritance that combines two or more types of inheritance (like single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical) in a single program. 

    Not Supported
    -------------
        - Multiple inheritance (via classes). Java uses interfaces for similar functionality
