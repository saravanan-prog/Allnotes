OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming)
=================================== 
    
    => OOPs is a programming paradigm [model or pattern] based on "objects" that contain data and methods. 
    It helps organize code for reusability and modularity.

    => It is a way of writing programs by using objects, just like real-world things.

    => Example:

            A Car, Student, Mobile, Bank Account
                Each object has:
                    Data (properties)
                    Actions (functions)


    Benefits of OOP
    ---------------
        - Easier code management.
        - Reusable code.
        - Scalable.

    Main Concepts :-
    ---------------

                Class          - A class is like a design or blueprint.
                Object         - An object is the real thing made from a class.
                Encapsulation :-  Wrap data and methods together with secure.
                Inheritance   :-  Create new classes from existing ones.
                Polymorphism  :-  Same method, different behaviors.
                Abstraction   :-  Hide unnecessary details.
