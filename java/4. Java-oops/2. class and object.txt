1. Class and Object
===================

    Class: 
        A blueprint for creating objects. 
        Defines properties and behaviors.

    Object: 
        An instance of a class.
        Has its own values for properties.

        Example class :-

            class Car {
                String color;         ------> properties
                void drive() {
                                      ---> behaviors
                }
            }


        Example Object creation :-

            Car myCar = new Car();
            myCar.color = "Red";



2. Real Time Example
====================

    Example 1: Banking System

        - Classes: Account, Customer, Transaction.
        - Objects: SB (Account), Saravanan (Customer) NFET(Transaction).
        - Methods: deposit(), withdraw().

    Example 2: Online Shopping System

        - Classes: Customer, Product, Order.
        - Objects: john (Customer), laptop (Product).
        - Methods: addToCart(), placeOrder().

    Example in Java

    class Customer {
        String name;
        void addToCart(Product p) {}
    }

    class Product {
        String name;
    }


    Benefits in Real-Time
    - Model real-world entities.
    - Manage complexity.
