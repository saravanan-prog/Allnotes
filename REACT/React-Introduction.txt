1. REACT
----------

    -   React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    -   React is used to build single-page applications.
    -   React allows us to create reusable UI components.


    1.1 Environment setup
    -------------------------
        1.1.1   Install the node js software version v16. https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.11.1/
        1.1.2   create one workspace in local c or D drive example: c:/development
        1.1.3   open that folder command prompt.
        1.1.4   npx create-react-app my-react-app
        1.1.5   cd my-react-app
        1.1.6   npm start

    1.2 ES6 
    ---------
         ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6.

            1.2.1       Classes
            1.2.2       Arrow Functions
            1.2.3       Variables (let, const, var)
            1.2.4       Array Methods like .map()
            1.2.5       Destructuring
            1.2.6       Modules
            1.2.7       Ternary Operator
            1.2.8       Spread Operator

    1.3 DOM
    ---------

        DOM stands for ‘Document Object Model’. In simple terms, it is a structured representation of the HTML elements that are present in a webpage or web app. 

        DOM represents the entire UI of your application.

        It contains a node for each UI element present in the web document. 


    1.3 Virtual DOM 
    ----------------

        React uses Virtual DOM exists which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM(a virtual representation of the DOM).
        Manipulating DOM is slow but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as nothing gets drawn on the screen.
        So each time there is a change in the state of our application, the virtual DOM gets updated first instead of the real DOM. 


    1.4 JSX
    -----------
        JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
        JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
        JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.


    1.5 React components
    ----------------------
        Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

        1.5.1   Components come in two types
        -------------------------------------

            1.5.1 Class components 
            1.5.2 Function components [React team offically recommeded Function components]


    1.6 Class Component Life cycle
    --------------------------------
        1.6.1   Constructor()
        1.6.2   componentWillmount()
        1.6.3   componentDidmount()


    1.7 React HOOKS - Function Components
    ------------------------------------------

        Hooks were added to React in version 16.8.
        Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.

        Rules
        -------
            You must import Hooks from react.
            Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
            Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
            Hooks cannot be conditional

        Hooks List
        -----------
        
            1.7.1   useState
            1.7.2   useEffect
            1.7.3   useContext
            1.7.4   useRef
            1.7.5   useReducer
            1.7.6   useCallback
            1.7.7   useMemo
