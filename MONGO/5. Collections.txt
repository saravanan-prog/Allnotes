collections
------------

    - CollectionsMongoDB stores documents in collections. 
    - Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.
    - MongoDB provides the db.createCollection() method to explicitly create a collection - with various options,
    - such as setting the maximum size or the documentation validation rules.


    Example
    -------
        db.createCollection("departments")
        show collections                        // show collections List
