What is a Foreign Key?
======================

    A foreign key is a column in one table that links to the primary key in another table.

        It creates a relationship between two tables.
        Helps to maintain data integrity (no invalid or unrelated data).


    Step 1: Create the parent table (with primary key)

        CREATE TABLE Students (
            id INT PRIMARY KEY,
            Name VARCHAR(100),
            Class VARCHAR(10)
        );


    Step 2: Create the child table (with foreign key)

        CREATE TABLE Marks (
            id INT PRIMARY KEY,
            StudentID INT,
            Subject VARCHAR(50),
            Marks INT,
            FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(id)
            ON DELETE CASCADE 
        );
