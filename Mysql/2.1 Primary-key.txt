What is a Primary Key?
======================
    - A Primary Key is a column (or group of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row.
    - No two rows have the same value in that column


    CREATE TABLE Students (
        StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        Name VARCHAR(100),
        Class VARCHAR(10)
    );
    

What is a Foreign Key?
======================
A foreign key is a column in one table that links to the primary key in another table.

    It creates a relationship between two tables.



    Step 1: Create the parent table (with primary key)

        CREATE TABLE Students (
            StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
            Name VARCHAR(100),
            Class VARCHAR(10)
        );

        CREATE TABLE Marks (
            MarkID INT PRIMARY KEY,
            StudentID INT,
            Subject VARCHAR(50),
            Marks INT,
            FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID)
        );
