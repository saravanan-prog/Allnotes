1. Database:
============
    - A database is an organized collection of data stored electronically.
    - Think of it as a digital filing cabinet where data is stored in a structured way.
    - Instead of paper files, you keep all your important information on a computer.
    - Data can be anything like student records, inventory, customer info, etc.


2. Database Management System
==============================
    - A DBMS is software that helps you create, store, manage, and retrieve data from a database.


3. Relational Database Management System
=========================================
    - An RDBMS is a type of DBMS that stores data in tables that are related to each other.
    
    Why tables?
    -----------

        Tables look like spreadsheets with rows and columns.
        Each table stores a specific type of data.
        Tables can be linked using keys to show relationships between data.

    Key features of RDBMS:
    -----------------------
        Uses Primary Keys to uniquely identify each row.
        Uses Foreign Keys to link tables together.
        Supports SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage data.
        Examples: MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL.


4. SQL [SQL stands for Structured Query Language.]
===================================================

    - SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

    - It is the standard language used to:
        Create, modify, and manage databases,
        Insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from tables,
        Control access and permissions in databases
